   ```

## 🚀 **How Infinite Loop Detection Works**

When processing critically full PST files, the system monitors for infinite space liberation cycles:

```
Emergency space liberation successful: 50.0MB freed
[PST immediately fills up again - cycle detected]
🔄 INFINITE SPACE LIBERATION LOOP DETECTED!
💡 Switching to Ultimate PST Handler...
✅ Successfully broke the infinite loop!
```

## 🎯 **Ultimate PST Handler Strategies**

1. **🔀 Move-Only Strategy**
   - Direct item movement without copy operations
   - Bypasses space issues entirely

2. **📤 Export-Reimport Strategy**  
   - Uses MSG file intermediation
   - No source PST space required

3. **⚡ Direct MAPI Strategy**
   - Low-level COM manipulation
   - Bypasses normal Outlook operations

4. **🔧 Third-Party Strategy**
   - Integration with external tools
   - Last resort for impossible scenarios

## 💻 **Requirements**
- **Windows** (Windows 10/11 recommended)
- **Microsoft Outlook** installed and configured
- **PST files** accessible to Outlook

*No Python installation required for executable versions!*
